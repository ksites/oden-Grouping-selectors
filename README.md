WHAT I learned from this Assignment.
Grouping Selectors 
Instead of having multiple classse in one element, this assignment asked for seperate classes to be called by Grouping Selectors 
Example:
.ClassA , .ClassB
Values they share together

.classA 
values they do not share together 

.classB
values they do not share together
